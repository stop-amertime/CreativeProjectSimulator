That's lovely. 

It's a saturated market these days, isn't it? 

[[Yes]]
[[No]]

Well you can't do that one, that's my thing. And <i>this</i> is my creative project so I'm not letting you simulate that. 




:: GiveUp {"position":"400,800","size":"100,100"}
You consider abandoning your creative project, and with it, your dreams. Your soul gradually withers, joining the millions of others who didnâ€™t quite reach their potential. 

Also, your lack of commitment to a creative project makes you less attractive to other creatives. The relationship you end up in is barren of life and spontaneity. 

Every day of the rest of your life feels identical, an inescapable Groundhog Day. Your life is fine, it's not <i>bad</i>. But, you live the rest of your life with a feeling that there's a lock deep inside you, that you never quite found the key for. 

<<return "Wait - no! I won't give up!">>
Give up.

============================================
<<set $healthBar = "[]".repeat(5)>>
<small>This is a random header to remind myself that I can do that. 
HEALTH: $healthBar

<<set $hasAgreedToHonesty = false>>

<<set $money = 10>>

A warning - you must be honest to participate in this game. You could just pick all the best options, but that will get you nowhere. 

<<checkbox "$hasAgreedToHonesty" false true>>
<<button "I agree" "Start-PickProjectType">><</button>>

You'd like to do something creative. That's nice. It's nice to have dreams. Perhaps one day you will be. What type of project is it?
